Time to learn Meteor and React. This app follows the tutorial 'ToDo App with React' that is found at:  
https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app

I am here:  
https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/adding-user-accounts

To run the app, go to the working directory and type 'meteor' in the terminal. Yep, that's it.

`// This comments JSX files`  
`{/* This is a multi-line JSX comment for React files */}`  
Also keep an eye out for self-closing and auto-closing HTML tags in JSX files.

In order to run this app in the android emulator, I had to open the project in Android Studio before running  
=> meteor run android  
iOS emulator works just fine, though.
